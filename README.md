CustomLauncherRewrite is a brand-new custom launcher for Toontown Rewritten. This launcher is based on my old one, [Multitoon Helper](https://github.com/hyperdefined/multitoon-helper). This one is built from the ground up and has many more features than the previous one. This launcher is designed for players who are annoyed of the current official launcher.

## Features
* Ability to save logins for multiple accounts. Sick of typing it in *every* single time?
* Add accounts right from the launcher. Don't need to mess around with files. 
* Encrypt login data with a passphrase. Your data is encrypted using [AES Encryption](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Advanced-Encryption-Standard).
* Launch the game directly from the launcher, no external scripts needed. Supports 2FA and ToonGuard.
* Check for TTR updates.

## Setup
* You need Java 8 or above installed.

After you have these things, download the latest [release](https://github.com/hyperdefined/CustomLauncherRewrite/releases). Throw the `exe` file into a new folder and run it. To add a new account, simply click "Add Account" and follow the steps. Double click the account to launch the game.

## Troubleshooting
### It says that it can't find my TTR installation.
If you have installed TTR in a different location, copy that installation path and change it in the options menu.

### It says my passphrase is wrong.
You passphrase was typed in wrong. You either typed it incorrectly when you added an account, or you keep typing it incorrectly when you login. Remove the account and re-add it back.

### I have an issue that is not listed here.
No problem! Create a new [issue](https://github.com/hyperdefined/CustomLauncherRewrite/issues) and include as much detail as possible, so I can help you out.
