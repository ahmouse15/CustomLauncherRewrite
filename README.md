CustomLauncherRewrite is an all purpose launcher for Toontown Rewritten. This launcher is based on my old one, [Multitoon Helper](https://github.com/hyperdefined/multitoon-helper). This one is built from the ground up and has many more features than the previous one. This launcher is designed for players who are annoyed of the current official launcher. This launcher supports Windows and Linux. Linux support is still very new, so expect bugs!

## Features
* Ability to save logins for multiple accounts. Instead of typing in a login every single time, you can save all of your accounts.
* Encrypt login data with a passphrase. Your data is encrypted using [AES Encryption](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Advanced-Encryption-Standard).
* Add accounts right from the launcher. Don't need to mess around with files.
* Launch the game directly from the launcher, no external scripts needed. Supports 2FA and ToonGuard.
* Update your TTR game files automatically.
* Built in invasion tracker. Invasion data is taken from [toon.plus](https://toon.plus/).
