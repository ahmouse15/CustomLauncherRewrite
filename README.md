CustomLauncherRewrite is an all purpose launcher for Toontown Rewritten. This launcher is based on my old one, [Multitoon Helper](https://github.com/hyperdefined/multitoon-helper). This one is built from the ground up and has many more features than the previous one.

## Features
* Save logins for multiple accounts. Save them with encryption or plaintext.
* Add accounts right from the launcher. Don't need to mess around with files.
* Launch the game directly from the launcher, no external scripts needed. Supports 2FA and ToonGuard.
* Update your TTR game files automatically.
* Completely separate from the official TTR launcher.
* Built in invasion tracker, field office tracker, and district tracking.
* Support for Windows and Linux.
